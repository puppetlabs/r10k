Puppet environment and module deployment

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/r10k.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/r10k)

Description
-----------

[workflow]: http://puppetlabs.com/blog/git-workflow-and-puppet-environments/

R10k provides a general purpose toolset for deploying Puppet environments and
modules. It implements the [Puppetfile](doc/puppetfile.mkd) format and provides a native
implementation of Puppet [dynamic environments][workflow].

Requirements
------------

R10k supports the following Ruby versions:

  - 1.9.3
  - 2.0.0
  - 2.1.0

R10k requires additional components, depending on how you plan on managing
environments and modules.

  - Installing modules from the Puppet Forge requires Puppet 3.0.0+ or later.
  Puppet 2.7 may work, but is generally not recommended as Puppet 2.7 is EOL.
  - Git is required for creating environments and modules from Git
  - SVN is required for creating environments and modules from SVN

Installation
------------

### Rubygems

For general use, you should install r10k from Ruby gems:

    gem install r10k
    r10k help

### Puppet Enterprise 3.x

Puppet Enterprise bundles a copy of Ruby, so if you do not want to use the
system version of Ruby with r10k, you need to use the bundled PE gem command for
installation:

    /opt/puppet/bin/gem install r10k
    r10k help

### Puppet 4

Puppet 4 bundles a copy of Ruby, so if you do not want to use the
system version of Ruby with r10k, you need to use the bundled puppet gem command
for installation.

    /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install r10k
    /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/r10k help

### Bundler

If you have more specific needs or plan on modifying r10k you can run it out of
a git repository using Bundler for dependencies:

    git clone git://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k
    cd r10k
    bundle install
    bundle exec r10k help

Usage
-----

R10k has two primary roles: installing Puppet modules using a standalone
Puppetfile, and managing Git and SVN based dynamic environments. For more
information see the topic specific documentation:

  * [Puppetfile Documentation](doc/puppetfile.mkd)
   * [Updating your Puppetfile](doc/updating-your-puppetfile.mkd)
  * [Environment Deployment Documentation](doc/dynamic-environments.mkd)
  * [Quickstart](doc/dynamic-environments/quickstart.mkd)
  * [Common Patterns](doc/common-patterns.mkd)
  * [Workflow Guide](doc/dynamic-environments/workflow-guide.mkd)

For more general questions, see the [FAQ](doc/faq.mkd).
