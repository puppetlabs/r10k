Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

### The default Git branch is 'master', while the default Puppet environment is 'production'. How do I reconcile this?

The default Git branch name is 'master', but this is a somewhat arbitrary name
and doesn't necessarily map to every use case. In the case of R10K it's generally
easiest to rename 'master' to 'production'. You can rename the master branch
with the following:

```
git branch -m master production
git push --set-upstream origin production
```

Note that this will only create a new branch called production with a copy of
master - to change the default branch for all subsequent clones, read on.

#### Changing the default branch for bare Git repositories

When you clone a repository, Git checks out the [currently active branch][git-clone]
on the remote repository. Changing this for a non-bare repository is simple - just
check out a different branch and subsequent clones from that repository will
use that branch.

For bare repositories things are a bit more complex. Bare repositories do not
have a working directory that can be checked out, but they do have a [symbolic
ref][git-symbolic-ref] that serves the same role. To change this, run the
following command:

```
git --git-dir /path/to/bare/repo symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/production
```

#### Changing the default branch for different Git services

For Git hosting services where you may not cannot directly invoke commands,
there are usually administrative tools to allow you to change the default branch
on your remote repositories:

  * [GitHub][github-default-branch]
  * [Bitbucket][bitbucket-default-branch]
  * [Gitolite v2][gitolite-v2-default-branch]
  * [Gitolite v3][gitolite-v3-default-branch]

#### I just installed r10k and I'm getting the error "undefined method `keys' for nil:NilClass"

This is a known bug when `:sources:` is missing from `/etc/r10k.yaml`. See [RK-4](https://tickets.puppetlabs.
