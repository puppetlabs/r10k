Usage
=====

R10k provides fairly fine grained controls over your environments to fit your
needs. If you want to do a full update of all of your environments and modules
and don't need it to be done in real time, you can trigger a full update and let
it run in the background. If you are actively developing code and need to run
very fast updates of one specific environment, you can do a targeted update of
that code as well.

All commands that deal with deploying environments are grouped under the `r10k
deploy` subcommand.

Command line invocation
-----------------------

### Deploying environments

Recursively update all environments:

    r10k deploy environment --puppetfile

The simplest way to use r10k is by simply updating all environments and modules
and takes the brute force approach of "update everything, ever." When this
command is run r10k will update all sources, create new environments and delete
old environments, and recursively update all environment modules specified in
environment Puppetfiles. While this is the simplest method for running r10k, is
is also the slowest by a very large degree because it does the maximum possible
work. This should not be something you run interactively, or use on a regular
basis.

Note: Forge modules are not updated unless the Puppetfile specifies a specific
version or 'latest'.

Update environments while avoiding unnecessary recursion

    r10k deploy environment

This will update existing environments and recursively create new environments.
Note that when an environment is deployed for the first time, it will
automatically update all modules as well. For subsequent updates only the
environment itself will be updated.

- - -

Update a single environment:

    r10k deploy environment my_working_environment

When you're actively developing on a given environment, this is the best way to
deploy your changes. Note that when an environment is deployed for the first
time, it will automatically update all modules as well. For subsequent updates
only the environment itself will be updated.

- - -

Update a single environment and force an update of modules:

    r10k deploy environment my_working_environment --puppetfile

This will update the given environment and update all contained modules. This is
useful if you want to make sure that a given environment is fully up to date.

### Deploying user modules

Update a single module across all environments.

    r10k deploy module apache

This is useful for when you're working on a module specified in a Puppetfile
and want to update it across all environments. See
[Puppetfile documentation](doc/puppetfile.mkd) for details on how this affects
forge vs. git/svn modules.

- - -

Update multiple modules across all environments.

    r10k deploy module apache jenkins java

- - -

Update one or more modules in a single environment.

    r10k deploy module -e production apache jenkins java

### Viewing environments

Display all environments being managed by r10k.

    r10k deploy display

Display all environments being managed by r10k, and modules specified in the
Puppetfile with the desired version.

    r10k deploy display -p

User accounts
-------------

When running commands to deploy code on a master, r10k needs to have write
access to your Puppet environment path and should create files that are
readable by the user account running the master. If you're using Puppet
Enterprise this account is `pe-puppet`, and if you're using Puppet open source
this account is `puppet`.

This can be done in a few ways. First off, you can run r10k as the puppet user
itself. You can also create a new user that has write access to the Puppet
environment path, has the same GID as the puppet user, and has a umask of 0027.
You can also run r10k as root, which is the simplest solution but does require
access control to the root user.
